# Alexey Taktarov (molefrog)

## Overview

Alexey Taktarov, known online as "molefrog", is a **design-minded full-stack engineer** who operates at the intersection of **product craft, technical architecture, and communication**. Based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

A "builder" not just in the coding sense — cares about **systems that scale, tools that stay simple, and experiences that feel well-designed**. Engineer + designer hybrid: enjoys both technical and visual design, with projects reflecting a bias toward UI quality and polish.

## Core Identity

- **Founder / ex-CTO / engineering leader**: Built and scaled engineering teams through acquisition-era complexity
- **Engineer + designer hybrid**: Technical depth combined with strong visual design sensibility
- **Open-source maintainer**: Long-running anchor projects with strong opinions on simplicity and developer ergonomics
- **Speaker / explainer**: Invests heavily in talks and teaching as part of thinking and contributing to the ecosystem

## Current Ventures

### something.new (Dec 2025 - Present)
A constrained vibe-coding tool for building embeddable, real-time interactive widgets. The agent produces a specific type of app: single-screen (no routing/scrolling), real-time by default (InstantDB for local-first state/presence), and opinionated design (curated libraries: React, Tailwind, Motion, Heroicons). Focus areas include sessions/events, "go live" flow, and UI/UX refinement. Built on the belief that constraints unlock creativity.

### "Persistent AI Computer" (Product Thesis)
Agent + code + disk + DBs + tunnels as durable infrastructure for doing business tasks through code. Not just "using agents" but building the conceptual and technical stack for them (tools, feedback, environment).

### Fira (YC W25) - Advisor
Former CTO and Co-founder, now serving as Advisor. Fira is an AI-powered financial research assistant helping analysts at M&A and investment firms accelerate their research and due diligence work. Part of Y Combinator Winter 2025 batch.

## Past Experience

### resume.io (2016-2021) - Co-founder & Head of Engineering
Co-founded resume.io, a resume builder that grew to serve millions of users. The company was acquired by Talent Inc. in 2021. As technical co-founder, Alexey built the engineering team and technical infrastructure from scratch.

## Technical Skills

**Frontend:** React, Svelte, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, framer-motion, Next.js, Remix
**Backend:** Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Deno, Postgres, Redis
**Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Workers, Edge Computing, Serverless
**Design:** Figma, UI/UX design, Animation

## Open Source

### wouter
Creator and maintainer of wouter, a minimalist React and Preact router library with 5,700+ stars on GitHub. Known for its tiny footprint (~1KB) and API similar to react-router. Featured in "React.js Open Source for the Past Month" as a Top-10 project.

GitHub: github.com/molefrog

## Side Projects

### domik.ltd
An illustrated interactive web-story featuring puzzles, animations, and mini-games. Alexey wrote, designed, and programmed the entire experience. Includes a house-building minigame where users can construct, photograph, and save their creations. Featured in a "Behind the Scenes" video documenting the creative process.

### Piano Tutor
An AI agent experiment with an unconventional interface: no chat, only piano keys. Users interact by playing notes — the agent offers options on screen, users respond by pressing keys. Built with Web Audio API and MIDI support. It can play melodies, give exercises to repeat, and teach chords.

## Creative Philosophy

Influenced early on by Bret Victor's "Inventing on Principle" (2012) and Stuart Memo's "JavaScript is the new punk rock", Alexey has developed a consistent creative thread over 10+ years of experimentation.

**Core Principles:**
- **Interactivity over static content** — Whether it's a blog post, presentation, or tool, use the platform fully. The web can do more than display text. Let people touch, play, explore.
- **Real-time and collaborative by default** — Things are meant to be shared. When multiple people can use something together, it becomes more alive.

**The Work Shape:**
Likes to **build from scratch**, define the constraints, then iterate toward something elegant and minimal. Gravitates toward products that combine:
- Real-time / multiplayer / collaborative dynamics (presence, sessions, rooms, shared state)
- Agentic tooling (LLMs + tools + environment + feedback loops) with a practical "how do we ship this?" angle
- Data + analysis infrastructure (DuckDB, SQLite, background processing)

Also does "public craft": writing, speaking, maintaining libraries — work that reinforces taste and clarity.

**Evolution of Ideas:**
- 2013: First JS experiments with PID Neural Network visualization using Bret Victor's Tangle library
- 2018: React + React Motion for composable animated presentations
- 2022: MDX discovery leading to domik.ltd — interactive storytelling with embedded puzzles and games
- 2024-25: AI agents with unconventional interfaces (Piano Tutor — interact by playing notes, not chatting)
- 2025: Constrained vibe-coding tool — embeddable one-screen apps, real-time by default (InstantDB), opinionated design

**On Constraints:**
Believes in the "paradox of choice" (Barry Schwartz) — too much freedom reduces creativity. Intentionally constrains tools to unlock better output: curated libraries, strict design rules, single-file components.

## Values & Motivations

**1. Care and Simplicity**
Prefers a minimal toolset, clean organization. Drawn to solutions that make complex systems feel simple.

**2. Autonomy and Meaning**
Becomes unproductive when motivation is missing. Dislikes following orders without clear reasoning. Strong need for agency + purpose alignment.

**3. Culture and How People Work Together**
Frames "engineering culture" as a superpower (rituals, principles, hiring, communication). Values transparency even when uncomfortable.

**4. Craft in Interfaces**
UI polish, animations, and "make it feel good" are first-order concerns, not afterthoughts.

## Strengths

- **Architectural simplification**: Consistently aims to reduce conceptual weight while keeping power
- **Taste + execution**: Iterates on visuals and interaction details with persistence
- **Clear thinking in systems**: Decomposes problems into primitives (agent + tools + FS + build + feedback)
- **Communication**: Strong ability to turn messy domains into teachable structure

## Friction Points

- **Motivation sensitivity**: If the "why" is missing, output drops sharply
- **Procrastination on "easy" tasks**: Pattern of deferring low-stimulation work in favor of interesting exploration
- **Conflict aversion**: Tries to avoid arguments; tough managerial conversations are emotionally expensive

## Interests

- Local-first web applications
- Multiplayer/collaborative apps
- Interactive storytelling
- Design engineering
- Web animations
- Typography
- AI agents with non-traditional interfaces

## Media & Publications
