                  A comprehensive introduction to React hooks, including a step-by-step tutorial on
                  building a fully-functional router library. This presentation showcases my work on
                  the initial version of wouter, an open-source project that is still actively
                  maintained. The goal was to demonstrate the built-in hooks provided by React and
                  how they can be combined.

                <p>
                  I am proud to have presented this at a Viipuri Library in Vyborg, which was
                  designed by Alvar Aalto. The library&apos;s emphasis on natural lighting inspired
                  me to create illustrated icons for each hook mentioned in the talk, together with
                  my friend and illustrator, Katya Simacheva.

                  A highly interactive presentation that explores the principles of creating fluid
                  and stateful animations in React. In this talk, I cover CSS transitions,
                  spring-based animations with react-spring, Canvas animations, and exit
                  transitions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I&apos;ve spent an incredible amount of time polishing the slides and coding the
                  demos that you can interact with. These demos are running on my own React
                  presentation engine â€” Presa, that I had fun hacking while procrastinating on the
                  slides.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The talk has been well received by the audience and was included in the list of
                  top-10 HolyJS talks.
