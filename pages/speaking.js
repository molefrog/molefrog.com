                  A comprehensive introduction to React hooks, including a step-by-step tutorial on
                  building a fully-functional router library. This presentation showcases my work on
                  the initial version of wouter, an open-source project that is still actively
                  maintained. The goal was to demonstrate the built-in hooks provided by React and
                  how they can be combined.

                  A highly interactive presentation that explores the principles of creating fluid
                  and stateful animations in React. In this talk, I cover CSS transitions,
                  spring-based animations with react-spring, Canvas animations, and exit
                  transitions.
