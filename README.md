Hi, I'm Alexey Taktarov. I build some web things, primarily in JS, Node, and Ruby.

I occasionally [speak](http://molefrog.com/stateful-animations/) at tech conferences, write some
[open-source](https://github.com/molefrog), and teach other people how to code. I love designing
UIs, playing around with animations, and writing performant web apps & backends.

Recently, I’ve finished my work on [resume.io](http://resume.io) — the company that I’ve co-founded,
and helped to build. If you have some interesting project or an idea for a startup, drop me a line,
I’m always happy to talk!
