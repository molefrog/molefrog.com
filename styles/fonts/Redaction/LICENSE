As part of the artists’ dedication to social justice and legal equity, the Redaction fonts are
distributed under the Open Font License. You can use them freely in your products and projects –
print or digital, commercial or otherwise. However, you can't sell the fonts on their own. The fonts
are available in 3 styles (Regular, Italic, Bold) and 7 grades of degradation for a total of 21
fonts. All fonts have full character sets for Latin-1 language support.

The team is particularly excited to see how the Redaction fonts get used, and will showcase examples
on the site in the future. Please keep in touch and share any examples of the fonts in use by
contacting us at info@redaction.us.

Special thanks to Titus and Dwayne for extending the invitation to participate in this noble work.
It is the team's hope that you will enjoy using Redaction.
